# Y2 CEP Final Project
### Description
Surveyinator is a survey analyser for anyone and everyone to use. 
It analyses survey responses through a variety of analysis methods,
such as mean, median and mode. It allows surveyors to get an general idea of what
the survey responses are like.

Surveyinator was originally developed to help our Computing teacher 
to find out about the demand of Y2 CEP (i.e how many of them are 
interested to choose CEP in Year 2), and get a consolidated 
picture of how they perceive the 9 weeks CS course based on student 
feedback on their Year 1 CS experience

Surveyinator is written fully in Python.
